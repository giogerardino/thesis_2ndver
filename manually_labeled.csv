RPpcv5xr7TA, give this video a little credit  at least they stuck to the safe places for tourists unlike some other travel vloggers who try to tell you that you can go anywhere with the same safety you would use in your home country   not true  there are many places such as tondo that those girls should never ever visit  manila has some safe places but it has many dangerous places where extreme poverty breeds extreme crime  if you visit stay in makati bgc moa and ortigas areas and  be ok  try to go to other parts of the city and you increase your risk of mugging pickpockets and even murder  in a nutshell the philippines expects foreigners to stay in tourist places and nice hotels and spend money at the malls  though it  guaranteed  be attacked outside of those places it also  guaranteed you  be  research first and  go to any locales without a few filipinos with you to guide you and deter bad things,neu
RPpcv5xr7TA, kind of confusing to many because manila or metro manila is a big city capital it comprise of  cities amp municipalities that includes the city of manila makati quezon city pasay etctourists are advise not to venture the city of manila  because of its negative reviews from travel agencies or survey agencies there are parts of manila that are safe amp not so safe it kind of frustrating sometimes because tourists tends to downgrade the capital as dangerous when in fact  not,neu

RPpcv5xr7TA,what is sad is that it is that filipinos themselves are propagating the bad image of manila  lived in the poor sectors of the city  and did not have any bad experience problem with filipinos is that they think lowly of themselves you will never hear thai vietnamese or cambodian people talk ill about their country in front of foreigners on a regular basis for filipinos this is automatici  know why probably because we really  have any pride or love for our country find any video on youtube that talks positively about the country  then check the comments there will be quite a number of filipinos enunciating all the bad things about the countrywhat these people  know is things are just as bad or even worse in other countries it is a given if you are a traveller you do not venture out to places where there are few people or in dark places or in seedy places you  walk around waving the latest  iphone in the face of hungry people if you know what i meanthere are places in new york that you  want to be caught walking alone ditto with paris london etc,neg

RPpcv5xr7TA, dangerous  safe it is better if you have relatives here so that they can guide you what to do here safe just take care of your gadgets or anything,neg
RPpcv5xr7TA,why does your vlog have to be about only you and what you think of the philippines why  you interview the driver to give other people a more realistic view this seems like you find yourself and your view very important and the country people and their views much less important  in high class ritzy areas to start and of course you will be protected there there is a tonne of security everywhere me on the other hand  canadian and i live in the slums but i have never had a problem loads of security  showing one side of the coin and leaving out slum areas so people can just assume  bad they really  people may stare a lot but they are friendly and more or less curious  never had a problem in  months even when travelling to masbate i go many places alone at all hours and the worst that has happened is a few kids will try and get you to give them money  do that they will likely use it on glue to sniff and if you get caught you will be fined or arrested give them food because they do the glue apparently to stop the hunger pains if you are street wise and know how to observe your surroundings manila is just as dangerous as any other large western city just watch out for traffic and keep money folded in your pocket not in a bag or wallet manila is great,neg

RPpcv5xr7TA,who made the title of this video seriously  are you sure  the most dangerous in worldi like the content of the video and how you guys described it but i  like the titlethank you for visiting philippines,neg

RPpcv5xr7TA,why do you have to name your video  quotthe most dangerous city in southeast asiaquot,neg
