lHHyiOyA_IY,EMOTIONAL JOURNEY through the PHILIPPINES,@demonknightdenzgaming5865,UC8aqJSDI-D7fPYUg8bo17fA,"Happy to be part of this family for both channels Making it happen Vlog and The Juicy Vlog. It&#39;s one of my inspirations to do what I love to do. One thing I can say for Making it happen Vlog is keeping it real all the time. That&#39;s what I love about you both. This also the reason you have a lot of followers on YouTube. The phases you say at the end of the videos keep me centered on what I do. I almost cry on the clip that you hit 100K, it&#39;s because of the hard work you put into the contents and videos you made. Always stay awesome, be positive and make it happen. Love you guys. Take care.
